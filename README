This program generates a word search puzzle for the user.  The user is prompted to enter the number of words they want to have in the word search.  They are then asked to enter each word, one at a time.  The program then generates a word search puzzle with the given words by sequentially attempting to place each word in a randomized spot and orientation until the necessary conditions for it fitting are met (that it can fit based on length, as well as what words, if any, it is overlapping).  Once this stage is finished, the generated word search is printed to the console.  The code can be quickly compiled and run by running the command "make" and then running "./wsgen".
