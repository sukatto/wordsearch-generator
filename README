This program generates a word search puzzle for the user.  The user is prompted to enter the number of words they want to have in the word search.  They are then asked to enter each word, one at a time.  After that, they are prompted to enter the size of the grid.  The program then generates a word search puzzle with the given words by sequentially attempting to place each word in a randomized spot and orientation until the necessary conditions for it fitting are met (that it can fit based on length, as well as what words, if any, it is overlapping).  Once this stage is finished, the generated word search is printed to the console.  Finally, the user is asked if they would like to save the word search to a file.  If they choose yes, the grid is saved to a file named by the user in puzzles/.  The code can be quickly compiled and run by running the command "make" and then running "./wsgen" in a terminal window.
